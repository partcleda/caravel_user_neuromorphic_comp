I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI search specialist. I can help you explore and understand your codebase efficiently.\n\nI can see you're working in the `/home/marcus/caravel_user_neuromorphic_comp` repository on the `feature/adj-design` branch. The repo has several modified files including Verilog RTL files, testbenches, and configuration files.\n\nHere's what I can do for you:\n\n1. **Find files** - Use glob patterns to locate files by name or type\n2. **Search code** - Use regex to find specific content across files\n3. **Read files** - View the contents of specific files\n4. **Navigate** - Explore directory structures and understand your codebase layout\n\nJust let me know what you'd like to explore! For example, I can:\n- Find all Verilog files in the project\n- Search for specific functions or signals\n- Read and analyze particular files\n- Help you understand the project structure\n- Find files matching specific patterns\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":714,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":242,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUiXvrMCi6vxPqBNWNMB1","type":"assistant","uuid":"ed2ec75e-a159-413b-8b21-f89c42f3c37d","timestamp":"2025-11-02T05:46:20.965Z"}
